% For every picture that defines or uses external nodes, you'll have to
% apply the 'remember picture' style. To avoid some typing, we'll apply
% the style to all pictures.
\tikzstyle{every picture}+=[remember picture]

% By default all math in TikZ nodes are set in inline mode. Change this to
% displaystyle so that we don't get small fractions.
